# Welcome!

I'm super glad and humbled you're thinking about contributing to one of my
projects. If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue
or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely
asked to change something. I appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't
want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, read the CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), the LICENSE,
and the README, all of which should be in this repository. If you have any
questions, just ping me on Twitter DM or email.
